# CampusRide - University Ride-Sharing System

This Software Requirement Specification (SRS) was created by Syed Rafidul Alam, Sayed Hasan Sami, Sheikh Sadi, Badhon Dalbot, Sunjana Binte Shameem as a part of the evaluation for System Analysis and Design (CSE 3411) course at United International University in Spring 2025 trimester.

## Overview

CampusRide is a ride-sharing system designed to provide affordable, safe, and convenient transportation for students, faculty, and staff within the university community. This SRS (System Requirements Specification) report details the system's goals, features, analysis, feasibility, design, and implementation strategies. It aims to create a localized ride-sharing platform that addresses the challenges of existing campus transport options, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability.

## Introduction

This SRS report outlines the requirements for the CampusRide system, which connects university students and staff for ride sharing. It explains the rationale behind the project and establishes a foundation for detailed design and development efforts.

### Introduction

The University Ride Sharing Management System is designed to provide a platform for university students and staff to share rides in a secure, cost-effective, and efficient manner. The system connects riders and drivers within the university community, ensuring safety and reducing transportation costs and environmental impact.

### Problem Statement

CampusRide addresses several key problems:
*   Lack of organized ride-sharing options among students and faculty.
*   High transportation costs for individuals.
*   Security concerns with using external ride-sharing platforms.
*   Difficulty in finding rides at odd hours or to/from campus.

### Motivation

*   Reducing carbon emissions and traffic congestion.
*   Encouraging a sustainable and collaborative campus culture.
*   Leveraging technology to solve everyday campus commuting problems.
*   Offering an alternative to services like Uber, Pathao, or inDrive, tailored for university use.

##  System Analysis

### Information Gathering

This section details the process used to gather information necessary for developing CampusRide as a university-exclusive ride-sharing system. This included surveys research paper analysis:

#### Competitor Analysis

A detailed evaluation of competing ride-sharing platforms (Uber, Pathao, Shohoz, Obhai, inDrive) was conducted to understand their features, pricing models, and user experiences.  Key aspects like driver verification, payment systems, and safety measures were analyzed. [Link to spreadsheet with competitor analysis data â€“ if available].

#### User Survey

A survey was distributed to university students and staff to assess ride-sharing preferences, commuting challenges, and desired system features. Key findings included a strong desire for affordability, security, and reliable availability.

#### Research Paper Analysis

Academic research papers on ride-sharing services in urban environments were reviewed to provide insights into best practices and potential challenges. Two relevant papers are cited above.

## Feasibility Analysis

Feasibility of the project has been analyzed and recomendation were given here. For example, the initial phase of the project has negative cash flow but is expected to break even within a year with appropriate scaling and partner development.

## System Design

Classes, Use Cases, Deployment Diagrams etc. diagrams were provided in this section. Then on these diagrams, an UI protype is presented.


## Future Work

*   Integration with university campus maps and navigation systems.
*   Implementation of real-time ride tracking and notifications.
*   Development of an admin panel for managing drivers and users.
*   Exploring premium features such as group ride booking and promotional offers.
